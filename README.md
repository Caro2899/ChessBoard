Chess Game

We will make use of the C++ concepts: inheritance, polymorphism, templates and operator overloading to create different pieces in the game of chess. We will create not only the basic 6 pieces used in international chess, but also other [fairy chess pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece) used in chess variants. While there are numerous variant pieces with different complexity of moves and rules, many of the simple pieces fall into a few categories which we will implement using C++ template classes.

If you are not familiar with the basic rules of chess, you may read the rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess). Brief explanations of the relevant concepts will also be included where necessary.
